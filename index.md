### WELL HELLO THERE!
Don't know what brought you here, but since you aksed, here's a little bit about me: I just finished a fellowship at [Harvard's Shorenstein Center](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/shorenstein-center-announces-spring-2017-fellows/) where among other things  [I wrote this paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/). Last year, I served on the Bernie Sanders campaign where [I was honored to work alongside](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-02-24/behind-bernie-sanders-revolution-lies-a-meticulously-engineered-grassroots-network) thousands of amazing grassroots leaders who made miracles happen. I now volunteer with some of them in a campaign called [Brand New Congress](http://brandnewcongress.org), an effort seeking to [replace pretty much the entire corrupt U.S. Congress](https://www.thenation.com/article/is-brand-new-congress-the-future-of-progressive-politics/) with a slate of honest and visionary local leaders. In my day job, I help organizations, campaigns and businesses fundraise, organize and make their users happier. If you think I might be able to help you or your organization, please email me at [me@zackexley.com](mailto:me@zackexley.com).

### New project

Inspired by the Alt Right's total take over of YouTube -- which more people watch now than all of TV (read my [paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/)) -- I'm making videos aim at improving the world's worldview. Check out the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVrE6_b8mFBXkodk6gO54rg). I'm just getting started!

### Other stuff I think about
I spend as much time as I can reading history and economics. I'm focused on how poor countries become rich -- and how declining economies (like America's) can turn things around.

### If you're looking for something else 
If you're a reporter or looking for me for some other reason, just email me@zackexley.com. Apologies in advance if I can't get back to you, but if we answered all our email, it's all we would all day, right?
