### WELL HELLO THERE!
Don't know what brought you here, but since you aksed, here's a little bit about me: I just finished a fellowship at [Harvard's Shorenstein Center](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/shorenstein-center-announces-spring-2017-fellows/) where among other things  [I wrote this paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/). Last year, I served on the Bernie Sanders campaign where I was honored to work alongside thousands of amazing grassroots leaders who made miracles happen. I now volunteer with some of them in a campaign called Brand New Congress, an effort seeking to replace pretty much the entire corrupt U.S. Congress with a slate of honest and visionary local leaders. In my day job, I help organizations, campaigns and businesses fundraise, organize and make their users happier. If you think I might be able to help you or your organization, please get in touch here: me@zackexley.com.

### New project

Check out the videos I'm working on [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVrE6_b8mFBXkodk6gO54rg). 

### Other stuff I think about
I spend as much time as I can reading history and economics. I'm focused on how countries that were very poor became prosperous, and have spent a lot of time thinking about how America can learn from those cases (including our own story!) to rebuild our economy and get 50 million Americans out of poverty and into great jobs. 

### If you're looking for something else 
If you're a reporter or looking for me for some other reason, just email me@zackexley.com. Apologies in advance if I can't get back to you, but if we answered all our email, it's all we would all day, right?
